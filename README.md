Server-side project for the _Where You At?_ project.

## Usage

Before running, make sure you have a `config.js` file with your Apigee credentials and information for data storage. If you do not have a `config.js` file, copy the `config.js.example` file and modify it with the appropriate information.

To run the project locally, run the following:

```
npm install --no-bin-links
npm start
```

The server will start up on port 1337 of the system.
